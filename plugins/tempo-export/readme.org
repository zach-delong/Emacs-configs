* tepmo-export

  This is a place for me to experiment with a plugin to export to tempo

  Todo:
  - [ ] Parse weekly clocktable buffer into one list where each entry is the date
  - [ ] Parse all rows into sub-lists
  - [ ] Filter out duplicate rows
  - [ ] Search rows for a Jira ticket
  - [ ] Format a dotted pair list under each day with (TICKET . time)
  - [ ] Provide the list to the user somehow to correct/add missing tickets
  - [ ] Upload to Tempo
  - [ ] Should my data structure be an array instead of a list?
